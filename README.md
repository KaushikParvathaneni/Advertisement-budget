# Advertisement-budget

The project involves analyzing advertising data to determine the impact of various media channels on sales. By employing multiple linear regression models, including those with interaction terms, I assess the individual and combined effects of TV, radio, and newspaper advertising. The project focuses on building statistical models to interpret and predict sales outcomes, visualizing these relationships through scatter plots and regression lines. Through this analysis, I aim to provide insights into the effectiveness of different advertising strategies and their potential synergies.
